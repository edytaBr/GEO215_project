# 1. Introduction
This analysis will consider the site selection for new fire station in Bergen. This is one of crucial question which decision makers have to answer due to potential risk of fires and its danger on society. In worst case scenario it can lead to loss of lives and properties and can lead to  state of emergency in the city. 

This is one of the topic in emergency service location selection and there are many studies for selecting optimum location such as simple selections done in terms of rudimentary calculation, past experience, or even predilection.[@location_gis]}  

In this assignment more sophisticated tools will be implemented, which make use of statistical and mathematical tools with accompany of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This will help to produce suitability map to select preferable location/area to build a new fire station in Bergen, Vestland. 

# 2. Methods and material

### Weighted overlay

The number and placement of fire stations in the city is usually based on the distance between stations, the population served, and the hazards at particular locations. It is crucial to minimize total travel time so that the response is as fast as possible.  
In this study the **Weighted Overlay** (WO) was used and its uses following steps to obtain the final suitability map:

- each raster layer is assigned a weight (higher value means that this factor is more significant for decision) (Tab. 1)

- values in raster are then reclassified to a common suitability scale

- raster values are overlayed

- each raster cells suitability value is multiplied by its layer weight (Tab. 1) rasters value, and then sum of all cells are summed up as an output layer and final map[@weighted_overlay].

| **Fire hazards areas**	| 35	|
| **Distance to existing stations**	| 25	|
| **Buildings**	| 15 	|
| **Population** |  15 |
|	**Roads** | 5	|
| **Student housing** |	5 |

Since weighted overlay takes rasters data as an input, there were several operations conducted to obtain  6 input raster layers (Fig. 1). Workflow is presented on Fig. 2 and described in the next subsection.

#### **Rasters reclassifications**\

*Fire hazard areas*

Since Bergen is the city that has many fire hazards areas (wooden buildings) it is decided that this factor has the highest weight in weighted overlay analysis (Table 5). The data related to fire hazards areas were used to define euclidean distance and then reclassified according to its importance (Table 4). It is decided that areas within 2 km from fire hazards objects are considered as factors that contribute to create new fire station, since fast reaction to fire events is important for this type of architecture. 

*Existing fire stations*

It is important that new model is taking under consideration existing infrastructure, thus euclidean distance from existing infrastructure was calculated and reclassified (Tab. 4 and 5). In the literature it is assumed that at a bare minimum, a fire station should be placed so that every part of the jurisdiction is within 5 miles ($\approx$ 8km) of a fire station and anything beyond 5 miles is considered as no recognized fire protection. [@evaluation_fire_station_loction]. Bergen is a different city, and according to current measurements the minimum distance between fire stations is 2,4 km and the highest is 8,4 km (Table 1). Since it is different that approved convention the distance 3,5km has value 0 in reclassification process (not suitable are), $\leq$ 7 value 1, $\leq$ 10,5 value 2, and $\leq$ 14 value 3 (most suitable area). This layer is second important in WO with weight 25%.

*Population and buildings* 

```{r fig-sub, echo = FALSE, fig.cap='Number of people and buildings from existing fire stations within 2km distance', fig.subcap=c('Population', 'Buildings'), out.width='.47\\linewidth', fig.asp=0.9, fig.ncol = 2}
pop = read.table("BrannSta_250m_pop_buffer_2km_mean.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ";", dec = ",")
data = read.table("data1.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = ",")


boliger = read.table("BrannSta_250m_boliger_buffer_2km_mean.txt", header = TRUE, sep = ";", dec = ",")

barplot(pop$MEAN, main='Number of people within 2km from Fire station',
        xlab="Fire station", ylab ="Population", col = "Lightblue", ylim = (c(0, 45000)), names.arg = pop$brannstasj, cex.names = 0.8)

barplot(boliger$MEAN, main='Number of buildings within 2km from Fire station',
        xlab="Fire station", ylab ="Buildings", col = "Lightblue", ylim = (c(0, 650)), names.arg = boliger$brannstasj, cex.names = 0.8)
```


Table 2 presents sum of people and Table 3 sum of building defined by 2 km buffer from existing fire stations. We can conclude that existing fire stations are located close to high inhabited areas with high number of buildings. Thus population and buildings rasters are reclassified into 3 classes (to keep classes big enough). They were divided according to the equal intervals. The higher reclassification value the more people and more buildings are located there, thus the reclassified area is more important for fire station placement. This is presented on Figure 1 (a and b). The number of people (Fig.1 (a)) and buildings (Fig.1 (b)) are important and crucial in defining localization of new fire station unit. These two layers have gotten the same weight in WO and moreover,  according to statistics, human ignition is to blame for 84% of all wildfires (in USA), and 97% of all those that threaten homes.[@fires_people]

*Roads proximity*

The distance to transport infrastructure is based as well on euclidean distance and has a value range from 0 to 1000m. It is assumed that up to 500m it is more suitable to build fire station (Tab. 4). Value are based on similar made by  Erden and Coskun (2010).

*Student housing*

Since there are many fire alarms (unfortunately false alarms, 38 in 2020 according to https://www.brannstatistikk.no/ at Fantoft) student houses location have to be considered. Nevertheless it is not the most important factor in WO, but it should have had some impact on fire station placement. The euclidean distance from student houses is divided into two classes by manual interval (Tab 4).

The final suitability map presents areas which are high suitable (Figure 6, orange areas) and Low suitable (blue). According to conducted calculations (Zonal geometry as table) suitable area stands for 4,8km (3% of total analysed area) and less suitable area stands for 150,75km (97%). According to the map, we can emphasize two main areas for new fir station locations. One is located in the city, second one is located in southern part of analysed area. First one is mainly determined due to high density of people and buildings as well as close proximity to fire hazards areas. Southern part of high suitable areas is determined mainly due to large distance from existing fire stations units. 
In the city, according to manual measurements in ArcGis Pro distance between 3 cell localization and closest stations *Sandviken* is 570m  *Hovedstasjonen* and two other proposed localization is 1,8km and 2,3km. According to the Table 2 and common criteria it is too close to build new unit. We have to pay attention that this locations are influenced by factors mentioned above. Second southern area is more reasonable. Due to significantly, large distance to existing infrastructure, this area lacks in fire stations coverage. Probably today, it is not so dense inhabited area, and there are not so many buildings but as it is known, due to urban sprawl we can expect this is the future, thus it should be considered as place where new fire station can located.

# 4. Discussion
The number and location of fire station is the key in an efficient response during fire events. Multi-criteria evaluation takes under consideration many factors hence, we could include various data sets in study. Nevertheless, some data are not obtained from local authorities (like student housing) thus the data quality can be low.

Since weighted overlay allows to specify importance of given factor by assigning weights it can provide reliable results. Concurrently, assigning weight to each layers can strongly influence our study. Here, weights were assigned mainly by intuition, and were not scaled by using more sophisticated methods.  It is common practice to use one of four different techniques when assigning the weights: ranking, rating, pairwise comparison, and trade of analysis [@weights]
The cell size of grid (resolution) is 250m x 250m. This can lead that our analysis is too general. Due to this low spatial resolution it is hard to differentiate small structures, and details that can contribute to more accurate results. According to this, one of improvement that can be made in this study is to to decreased cell size and get more detailed information and crucial factor like `Anlegg med farlig stoff` from geonorge.no. 

Finally, the suitability map from WO may shows sharper transition between two obtained 2 classes[@MCE]. However, it should not be interpreted as sites that are totally suitable and totally non-suitable sites. As it is described on the final map these two classes are areas with: high suitability and low suitability because we we cannot completely exclude "blue area" (Figure 6. )[@MCE]
